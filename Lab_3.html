            The Kardashev scale (Russian: Шкала Кардашева, romanized: Shkala Kardasheva) is a method of measuring a civilization's level of technological advancement based on the amount of energy it is capable of using. The measure was proposed by Soviet astronomer Nikolai Kardashev (1932–2019)[1] in 1964[2] and was named after him.

The scale is hypothetical, and refers to energy consumption on a cosmic scale. Various extensions of the scale have since been proposed, including a wider range of power levels (Types 0, IV to V) and the use of metrics other than pure power (e.g., knowledge economy or resource mastery).[3][4]

Kardashev first outlined his scale in a paper presented at the 1964 Byurakan conference in Armenia, a scientific meeting that reviewed the Soviet radio astronomy space listening program. The paper, titled "Передача информации внеземными цивилизациями" ("Transmission of Information by Extraterrestrial Civilizations").[2] Starting from a functional definition of civilization, based on the immutability of physical laws and using human civilization as a model of extrapolation, Kardashev's initial model was developed. He proposed a classification of civilizations into three types, based on the axiom of exponential growth:

        </h1>
        <h1>
            A Type I civilization is able to access all the energy available on its planet and store it for consumption. Hypothetically, they should also be able to control natural events such as earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, etc.
A Type II civilization can directly consume a star's energy, most likely through the use of a Dyson sphere.
A Type III civilization is able to capture all the energy emitted by its galaxy, and every object within it, such as every star, black hole, etc.
        </h1>

        <h1>
            n a second article, entitled "Strategies of Searching for Extraterrestrial Intelligence", published in 1980, Kardashev wonders about the ability of a civilization, which he defines by its ability to access energy, to sustain itself, and to integrate information from its environment.[5] Two more articles followed: "On the Inevitability and the Possible Structure of Super Civilizations" and "Cosmology and Civilizations", published in 1985 and 1997, respectively;[6][7] the Soviet astronomer proposed ways to detect super civilizations and to direct the SETI (Search for Extra Terrestrial Intelligence) programs.

Several scientists have conducted various searches for possible civilizations, but with no conclusive results.[8] However, based on these criteria, unusual objects, now known to be either pulsars or quasars, were identified.[9]
